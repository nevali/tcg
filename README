This is 'tcg', a test-card (or test pattern) generator.

The intention is for tcg to be able to generate a variety of colour-accurate
test patterns at any practical resolution, at up to 16 bits per channel,
and stored in any of a number of formats.

To-do/Outstanding issues:

* Currently, tcg only generates the EBU "100% intensity colour bars" pattern.

* The actual Y/Cb/Cr values in colourmap.c are in need of review.

* YCbCr TIFF output does not properly set the colourmetry metadata.

* There is no 10-bpc output option.

* JPEG2000 should be added as an interchange format.
