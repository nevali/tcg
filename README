This is 'tcg', a test-card (or test pattern) generator.

The intention is for tcg to be able to generate a variety of colour-accurate
test patterns at any practical resolution, at up to 16 bits per channel,
and stored in any of a number of formats.

To-do/Outstanding issues:

* The actual Y/Cb/Cr values in colourmap.c are in need of review.

* YCbCr TIFF output does not properly set the colourimetric metadata.

* There is no 10-bpc output option.

* JPEG2000 should be added as an interchange format.

* Multiple frames cannot be written with ffmpeg-style pattern filenames
  (currently for raw output they are appended to the file; TIFFs are written
  as multiple pages).


Using tcg
=========

Run 'tcg -h' for usage information. There are command-line options to:

* Specify the type of test pattern to generate.

* The frame size (if you specify one dimension only, it is assumed to be a
  height, and the width will be calculated as (h * 16) / 9.

* The frame index or range (counted from zero) for multi-frame patterns.

* Split the frame into identical tiles.

You can write multiple output files in different formats for the same frame.
Prefix the filename with the format name (e.g., 'tiff-y16:myframe.tiff').

For example, to write a single frame in 16-bit TIFF format containing only
the luma (Y) channel, consisting of a UHDTV 8K image made up for a 4x4 grid
of the "EBU 75%" test pattern, you would invoke:

$ tcg -s 7680x4320 -T 4x4 -t ebu75 tiff-y16:frame.tiff

Building from a git checkout
============================

You will need autoconf and automake, as well as the usual toolchain. You
need libtiff installed (including its -dev or -devel package, if that's how
you installed it) if you want TIFF output.

$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ ./buildtools/autogen
$ ./configure [--with-libtiff=/prefix/of/libtiff]
$ make

See the source of buildtools/autogen for environment variables you can set if
it doesn't find your copies of aclocal, automake, autoconf, and so forth.
